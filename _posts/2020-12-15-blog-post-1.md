We have put ether-monkey.com in production , and a first payment of 1 ETH is made to 1 of our developers for one feature in sprint 1. Other 4 features worth 4 ETH are under processing.

We will release the plan for the sprint 2, maybe you can help to join?

We have fixed some bugs for ether-monkey. There are at least 3 challenges with the current block-chain based development:

how to upgrade without losing data, and be backward compatible;

solve the performance issues, for block chain read tasks, we plan to have a cache to increase the speed, however, how to ensure the consistency is still a problem under discussion.

High GAS fee, this might be the hardest part, which involves lots of design considerations.
