### Thought
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> about
1. To begin with, if the P/H ratio is high, there will be more miners joining the network and the security level of the system will be improved;
2. There is no neccessary relationship between the P/H ratio and the trend for the price;
3. Comparison should be between similar coin families, for example, BTC/BCH/LTC are in the same family while ETH/ETC are in the same family;
4. P/H ratio might not be applicable in the PBFT based algorithms.
