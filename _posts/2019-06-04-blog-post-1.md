### Chart

| coin name   | 05/20  | 05/22  | 05/24  | AVG    | price | P/H   | 
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
|  BTC        | 57.4   | 50.7   | 51.7   | 53.2   | 8025  | 150.8 |
|  BCH        | 2.5    | 2.1    | 2.3    | 2.3    | 410   | 178.3 |
|  LTC        | 0.38   | 0.4    | 0.31   | 0.36   | 102   | 283   |
|  ETH        | 0.17   | 0.16   | 0.16   | 0.165  | 252   | 1527  |
|  ETC        | 0.0088 | 0.0083 | 0.0082 | 0.0084 | 7.28  | 866   |

### Thought
1. To begin with, if the P/H ratio is high, there will be more miners joining the network and the security level of the system will be improved;
2. There is no neccessary relationship between the P/H ratio and the trend for the price;
3. Comparison should be between similar coin families, for example, BTC/BCH/LTC are in the same family while ETH/ETC are in the same family;
4. P/H ratio might not be applicable in the PBFT based algorithms.
