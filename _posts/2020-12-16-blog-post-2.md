Ether monkey is a good idea, however, due to the sky rocketing fee in the Ethereum block chain, the website is almost not functional.

So now, I am working on another project -- Decentralized Mutual Fund. Now every one is familiar with DeFi, how about a fund built up on it?
Everyone can invest on a fund with an ETH address, and every transaction of the fund is transparent to the stake holders, and if the stakeholders like, they can withdraw their fund without any bidie's permission.
