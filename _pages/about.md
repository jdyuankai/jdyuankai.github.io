I grew up in Hengyang, a middle size city in the province of Hunan, China. 
After 18 years living with my parents, 
I went out my home town for the first time in my life to Changsha and had a joyful undergraduate study in [Hunan University](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/jgsz/tsxy/rjxy.htm) learning Software Engineering. 
After that I spent 3 years in [Peking University](http://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Shiwen Yu](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Shiwen) for NLP research. 
Then I headed for Atlanta at [GaTech](https://www.cse.gatech.edu/) and earned my PhD degree under Prof. [David A. Bader](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uXUA1pgAAAAJ&hl=en) 
in the area of combinatorial research for bioinformatics and graph analysis. 
My software engineering career started late at the age of 29, and I get my first job at Oracle in the Bay area working on [Golden Gate](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/goldengate.html), 
a data base replication software. 
2 and half years later, I moved back to China and live in Hangzhou, and worked in Alibaba Cloud on [ODPS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-maxcompute---bringing-data-to-life_374338) -- a big data platform. 
After a short stint in [TRIAS Lab](https://www.trias.one/) working on [Leviatom](https://github.com/trias-lab/Documentation) 
and [StreamNet](https://github.com/StreamUnion/StreamNet/) project (also see [website](http://www.streamnet-chain.com), [Ether-Monkey](ether-monkey.com)). 
I now work for Google on [Android Automotive OS system](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906777/volvo-xc40-suv-ev-native-android-auto-google-assistant-maps).
